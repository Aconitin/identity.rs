# Identity Communication

This crate implements the [DIDComm Messaging standart](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/) by the [Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)](https://identity.foundation/) which is also implemented by the Aries Framework. That means identity agents can communicate with each other.

DIDComm Messaging is designed to be transport independent, including message encryption and agent message format.
